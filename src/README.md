# Overview

Hello and welcome to the official documentation of µLab at The Cooper
Union for the Advancement of Science and Art!  We've been a completely
student-run organization responsible for maintaining the computing
resources of the Electrical Engineering department at the Albert Nerken
School of Engineering for over 30 years!

As far as we're aware, µLab is one of the only student-run organizations
that exist in the United States with near-complete autonomy from its
parent institution.  With that comes a few perks:

* Full control over the `199.98.27.0/24` subnet
* Dozens of virtual machines & containers hosting services
* Fifty-five workstations which are all centrally managed & orchestrated
* Six physical servers (including a GPU compute node!)
