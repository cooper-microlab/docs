# VS Code Remote Development

[VS Code] is one of the most popular text editors, and it'd be a shame
if you couldn't use it on µLab hosts if it is your editor of choice.
Thankfully Microsoft provides an easy-to-use [editor extension] that
allows working remotely over SSH without much configuration.  Feel free
to reference the [official guide], as we'll only cover configuration
changes and quirks you may run into while remotely editing on µLab
hosts.

> Before getting started, we *highly* recommend you add µLab hosts to
> your [SSH configuration] to decrease the complexity of connecting!
